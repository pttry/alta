  ------- MODEL REPORT ------
  The un-condensed model contains:
      255 variables comprising 274 thousand components
  and 225 equation blocks comprising 255 thousand separate equations.
  
      39 variables (comprising 19 thousand components) will be backsolved for.
      21 variables (comprising 233 thousand components) were substituted out.
      14 variables (comprising 14 thousand components) were omitted.
  
  So the condensed model contains:
      181 variables comprising 7279 components
  and 165 equation blocks comprising 3034 separate equations.
  ------- END OF MODEL REPORT ------
  
  
  Total memory currently used for all arrays is approximately 2.23 megabytes.

  %% ADVICE. During this run MMNZ,MMNZ1 were
       reallocated 1 times. This may have
     slowed down this run considerably.
   We strongly suggest that you include an appropriate
     statement of the form "start with mmnz = <value> ;"
       in your Command file.
   [See Section 32.3 of the GEMPACK Manual, "MMNZ: Allocating memory for the LU
    decomposition".][TopicID:gpd3.13.3]
   [Be guided by the minimum values shown just above.]
  
  Total memory currently used for all arrays is approximately 2.23 megabytes.
  [This does NOT include memory related to MMNZ, MMNZ1 and MMNZ2. The
   associated arrays are not allocated.]
  [Add about 5-10 megabytes for the memory used by the code.]
  [The likely maximum memory used in this run has
    been reported earlier - search for "most memory".]
