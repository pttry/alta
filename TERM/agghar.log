Program AggHAR:
  Using OLD input file:                 premod.har
    and SUP supplementary mapping file: aggsupp.har
to make NEW aggregated file:            aggmod.har

Options:
   Headers unaffected by aggregation will be copied [no U option].
   Original set names will be used on aggregated headers [P option].
   Memory-conserving method will NOT be used [no S or M option].
Read SUP file: aggsupp.har     flavour: New Fujitsu
Opened OLD file: premod.har     flavour: New Fujitsu

Scanning RE matrices on OLD file for sets.....
The following sets were found in RE matrices on the OLD file (size in brackets):

   DST(19)
   SRC(2)
   USR(34)
   ORG(19)
   MAR(2)
   PRD(19)
   OCC(59)

The following additional sets were found in the SUP file (size in brackets):
   Fortran(1)
   REG(19)
   AGGCOM(30)
   AGGREG(19)
   AGGIND(30)
   AGGUSR(34)
   WAGGSET(10)

The following subset relations were detected:
   COM(30) subset of AGGCOM(30)

   USR(34) subset of AGGUSR(34)
   ORG(19) subset of DST(19)
   ORG(19) subset of PRD(19)
   ORG(19) subset of REG(19)
   ORG(19) subset of AGGREG(19)
   MAR(2) subset of COM(30)
   MAR(2) subset of AGGCOM(30)
   PRD(19) subset of DST(19)
   PRD(19) subset of ORG(19)
   PRD(19) subset of REG(19)
   PRD(19) subset of AGGREG(19)
   REG(19) subset of DST(19)
   REG(19) subset of ORG(19)
   REG(19) subset of PRD(19)
   REG(19) subset of AGGREG(19)
   AGGCOM(30) subset of COM(30)
   AGGREG(19) subset of DST(19)
   AGGREG(19) subset of ORG(19)
   AGGREG(19) subset of PRD(19)
   AGGREG(19) subset of REG(19)
   AGGIND(30) subset of IND(30)
   AGGIND(30) subset of USR(34)
   AGGIND(30) subset of AGGUSR(34)
   AGGUSR(34) subset of USR(34)

The following mappings were recognized in the SUP file:
   Mapping MAPREGD from DST(19) to AGGREG(19)
   Mapping MAPREGS from ORG(19) to AGGREG(19)
   Mapping MAPREGP from PRD(19) to AGGREG(19)
   Mapping MAPCOM from COM(30) to AGGCOM(30)
   Mapping MAPIND from IND(30) to AGGIND(30)
   Mapping MAPUSR from USR(34) to AGGUSR(34)

Set DST(19) will be mapped by Mapping MAPREGD from DST(19) to AGGREG(19)

Set ORG(19) will be mapped by Mapping MAPREGS from ORG(19) to AGGREG(19)

Set PRD(19) will be mapped by Mapping MAPREGP from PRD(19) to AGGREG(19)

Set COM(30) will be mapped by Mapping MAPCOM from COM(30) to AGGCOM(30)

Set IND(30) will be mapped by Mapping MAPIND from IND(30) to AGGIND(30)

Set USR(34) will be mapped by Mapping MAPUSR from USR(34) to AGGUSR(34)

No explicit mapping from set SRC(2)
   Above set will not be remapped.

No explicit mapping from set MAR(2)
   However MAR(2) is subset of COM(30)
       which IS mapped by MAPCOM to set AGGCOM
   Created new Mapping MAPMAR from MAR(2) to MAR(2)

No explicit mapping from set OCC(59)
   Above set will not be remapped.
